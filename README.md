# ProjectsManagementSystem

a.	Goals:
The main goal of this software is to help the professor (customer) in the process of managing the projects of the students. Rather than manually storing and remembering documents and details about each project, professor can use this software to swiftly go through the process with the help of few mouse clicks only.

b.	Problem Statement:
In the existing set-up, professor has to note down all the students’ details manually. He also has to sort these students into groups according to their projects. These tasks are usually done on paper or excel sheet or any such document. This can make the professor’s task tedious since details can be lost/mishandled or multiple copies of same group details can be generated if any change has to be done. 
Also, the professor has to keep a track of upcoming deadlines regarding a project. Moreover the professor may not be able to keep a check on a group’s progress. We are developing project management system to reduce his memory load and help the professor simplify the process of managing all these details.

c.	Proposed Solution:
In order to solve the above mentioned problems, I am developing a software which will manage all the details of the project. The professor will be able to add students’ details in the system. Moreover students can be grouped together for a group project and the details will then appear for the project as a whole group. 
Once the software is set up with all the details, the whole process of project management gets automated. The project will provide a tracking system through which the professor can track the progress of each project. Professor will have to pre-define the deadlines for all projects. Once a group has finished a task for a given deadline, professor can check it as achieved in the system. Once all the projects are finished and the semester is over, professor can reset the software using the report generation functionality. Finally, it provides a functionality to reset the system by clearing all existing records. So the system will be ready to use for the next semester.
